Hi, space alien here (caveat - I don’t believe in ANY religion. Proof: I love a tranny and most religions say that is forbidden love. Religion – suck my balls).

Song of the moment … Chainsmokers, Paris (requested by Marie from Cebu!).

Are we living in a simulation? Explain like I’m five!

Simple quantum gravity (unified field theory) experiment you can do yourself at home, Kids. Heck, a five-year-old could do it. Well, I mean, a five-year-old Culture citizen…

Want to finally know once and for all if reality is simulation? Well, you can never know for 100%, but you can know within 5-sigma confidence. It all depends on the value of N below.

Test it yourself at home!

What you need:

1. A special sort of mirror (see video)
2. to the power of N totemized symbols in Marain (learn _real_ Marain first - not the nonsense from the Books we sent you as inspiration)
3. A pencil

Yep – that’s pretty much it.

What you need to do:

1. Set up your 2 to the power of N totemized symbols
2. Make sure your mirror is providing electromagnetic energy onto the focal point (so you can’t do this in a pitch-black room).
3. Close your eyes and make a prayer or a wish or a question. Ask real hard. Focus for as long as you can. Meditate, even. Pray / meditate / clear your mind / whatever.
4. Rotate your pencil hard but keep it’s centre of mass directly at the focal point.
5. See where your pencil ends up!

Why is this a unified field theory experiment?

1. The mirror is providing electromagnetic field energy to the focal point (and all sorts of non-gravitational fields, in fact).
2. Quantum gravity is keeping the pencil pinned to the floor
3. Quantum noise (God?) determines where the pencil ends up

Try it!

How do you know what this means?

1. Run the experiment 100 times and keep a score of the symbols. If the universe is NOT a simulation, then you should expect roughly the same number of results for each symbol (according to the law of large numbers).
2. If the universe is a simulation, then you will have skewed statistics
